The major new feature is the ability to customize color maps, with XTerm, VGA and CSS color maps built-in. This was contributed by @harrah in [#9](https://github.com/dblock/jenkins-ansicolor-plugin/pull/9). It also has a few notable bug fixes, including proper support for background and foreground color reset, which caused output from the colorize Ruby gem not to be colored ([#5](https://github.com/dblock/jenkins-ansicolor-plugin/issues/5)).
