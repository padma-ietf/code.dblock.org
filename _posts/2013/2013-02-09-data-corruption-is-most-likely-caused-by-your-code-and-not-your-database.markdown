I am increasingly convinced that those who blame MongoDB for any kind of data corruption are waving hands out of desperation. Every single time I had an issue with data I ended up finding code that I’ve written or code that was written in a library that I used. The hardest bugs involve some kind of concurrent operation, including one I’ve described in a new post on the Artsy Engineering blog: [Data Corruption and Concurrent Updates to Embedded Objects w/ MongoDB](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2013/02/09/data-corruption-and-concurrent-updates-to-embedded-objects-with-mongoid/). Read it, especially if you are using an ODM to manipulate embedded objects.

I also want to point out two magical lines of code that I use all the time.

{% highlight ruby %}
Moped.logger = Logger.new($stdout)
Moped.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
{% endhighlight %}

Knowing what Mongoid is doing is half the battle.
