I’ve released [AnsiColor](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ansicolor), a Jenkins plugin you’ve all been waiting for.

How long have you been waiting? Years. This question seems to popup regularly on the users list, [2009](http://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/How-i-can-use-colors-in-output-td955080.html), [2011](http://groups.google.com/group/jenkinsci-users/browse_frm/thread/6c06f6c871353a92/df7fd56ecae7574a?lnk=gst&q=color+console#df7fd56ecae7574a) and again [recently](http://groups.google.com/group/jenkinsci-users/browse_frm/thread/aea4546a612f4bc4/caeca86316136e91?lnk=gst&q=color+console#caeca86316136e91). It looks like billions of Jenkins users are suffering from lack of color in console output. We’ve taken color for granted in our favorite shells and upgrading to Jenkins looks like a major step back. The absence of ANSI color support is particularly hurting the Ruby community and is likely the break-it or make-it barrier for the adoption of Jenkins by the latter. It’s well known that Ruby developers are a bunch of happy people and a world without color is a sad, sad world.
